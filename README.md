### Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm**: Latest LTS version recommended.

git clone https://github.com/M-Sayed939/Movie-Reservation-FrontEnd.git
cd movie-reservation-frontend
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3\. Run the Development Server

This project is pre-configured with a proxy (`proxy.conf.json`) to avoid CORS issues. It will automatically forward API requests from `http://localhost:4200/api` to your backend at `http://localhost:8081/api`.

```bash
ng serve --open
```

The application will start, and your browser will open to `http://localhost:4200`.
